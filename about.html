	  <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Solo Roleplay Engine is a little app for solo roleplaying on the go. Powered by MUNE, roleplay anywhere! 
      This app was highly inspired by <a href="https://rpgsolo.com">RPGsolo</a>, and was primarily designed because RPGsolo is not supported on mobile, and the mobile version has limited functionality. </p>
