	  <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Solo Roleplay Engine is a little app for solo roleplaying on the go. Powered by MUNE, roleplay anywhere! 
      This app was highly inspired by <a href="https://rpgsolo.com">RPGsolo</a>, and was primarily designed because RPGsolo's mobile version has limited functionality. </p>

      <h2>How to use!</h2>
      <p>
          This app uses the MUNE oracle, look <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/print/rkmo0t9k4Q">there</a> for
          some information. This app tracks intervention points for you, you don't need to track them yourselves.
          Press enter after you are done typing on the "Action/Narration" input to add text to the log.
          The log is a log of literally everything you have done in your game. Stuff like portents, dice rolls and oracle results all get added to the log. You can clear the log at any time by clicking or pressing the "CLEAR LOG" button.

          The dice roller is very simple: just use traditional dice notation, like 2d6+4. Fudge/Fate dice are also supported.
          To roll fudge dice, just type "4dF" into the roller and press "ROLL".
